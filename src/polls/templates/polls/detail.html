<!-- Since we’re creating a POST form (which can have the effect of modifying data), 
    we need to worry about Cross Site Request Forgeries. Thankfully, you don’t have to 
    worry too hard, because Django comes with a very easy-to-use system for protecting 
    against it. In short, all POST forms that are targeted at internal URLs should use 
    the {% csrf_token %} template tag. -->
